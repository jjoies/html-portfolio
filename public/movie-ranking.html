<h2> My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite Studio Ghibli movies! I've watched this a ton as a kid. I love the story, the characters, and the art style.</p>
<h3>The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes</h3>
<p>I recently watched this movie because I grew up reading and watching the original Hunger Games Trilogy. The story was so captivating and I loved learning about the early days in the HG world.</p>
<h3>Tangled</h3>
<p>I love Disney's princess movies, but I think this is my favorite one. The songs are great and the characters are so loveable!</p>
